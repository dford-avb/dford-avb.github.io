# Prior to Q3 2017, we weren't using variables for Openmage product names. When Openmage leadership announced
# a product renaming initiative, the Devdocs team decided to replace plain text instances of old product
# names with variables that would automatically pull in the new product name.

# Here's a reference of old-to-new Openmage product names for future reference:

# Community Edition (CE)          ---> Open Source
# Enterprise Edition (EE)         ---> Commerce
# Enterprise Cloud Edition (ECE)  ---> Commerce Cloud
# Enterprise Edition for B2B      ---> Commerce for B2B

#NOTE: The new product name variables use the old product name abbreviations (e.g., ce, ee, ece, b2b). 

# Product Name variables

ce: Openmage Open Source
ee: Openmage Commerce
b2b: Openmage Commerce for B2B
mbi: Openmage Business Intelligence

# Cloud product name variables
ece: Openmage Commerce Cloud
ct: ece-tools

# TIP: Use the following syntax to use a variable in the documentation source: {{site.data.var.xx}} where xx
# is the variable value.
