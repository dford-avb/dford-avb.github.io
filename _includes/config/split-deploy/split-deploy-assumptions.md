To use pipeline deployment, we assume you are:

*	An experienced system integrator with excellent knowledge of Openmage configuration options.
*	Managing a large Openmage site (thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs)) and want to keep production site downtime to a minimum.
*	Somewhat knowledgeable about PHP programming.
*	Experienced with source control methods.

	To use pipeline deployment, we assume your Openmage code is in a source control repository. In this guide, we assume you're using Git but the choice of repositories is up to you.
